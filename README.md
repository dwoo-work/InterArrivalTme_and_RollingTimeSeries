# Recency Analysis

For this project, it will demonstrate to you on how to perform recency analysis, using the inter-arrival time. On top of that, we will plot charts using the moving average (MA).

This is important for different supply chain purposes, such as forecasting, performing stock allocation, and visualising sales trend.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install:

- pandas: to perform data administration by pulling in .csv or .xlsx files.
- matplotlib: to perform data visualisation and graphical plotting.
- datetime: to manipulate date and time object data.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install datetime
```

## Sample Dataset

You can download the sales_data_sample_utf8.csv file from the source folder, which is located [here](https://github.com/dwoo-work/InterArrivalTme_and_RollingTimeSeries/blob/main/src/sales_data_sample_utf8.csv).

Ensure that the file is in CSV UTF-8 format, to avoid UnicodeDecodeError later on.
