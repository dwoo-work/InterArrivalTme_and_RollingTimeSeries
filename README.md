# Recency Analysis and Time Series Analysis

For this project, it will demonstrate to you how to perform recency analysis (using inter-arrival time), as well as perform time series analysis (using rolling time series)

This is important for different supply chain purposes, such as forecasting, performing stock allocation, and visualising sales trend.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install:

- pandas: to perform data administration by pulling in .csv or .xlsx files.
- matplotlib: to perform data visualisation and graphical plotting.
- datetime: to manipulate date and time object data.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install datetime
```

## Sample Dataset

You can download the sales_data_sample_utf8.csv file from the source folder, which is located [here](https://github.com/dwoo-work/InterArrivalTme_and_RollingTimeSeries/blob/main/src/sales_data_sample_utf8.csv).

Ensure that the file is in CSV UTF-8 format, to avoid UnicodeDecodeError later on.
